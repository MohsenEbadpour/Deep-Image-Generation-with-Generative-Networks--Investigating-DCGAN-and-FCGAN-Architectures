# Deep Image Generation with Generative Networks: Investigating DCGAN and FCGAN Architectures
## Overview

In this project, the focus was on implementing deep generative networks, specifically DCGAN(Deep Convolutional GAN) and FCGAN(Fully Connected GAN), using Keras and Python programming language on the cat dog dataset (available at https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cats_vs_dogs). The first step was loading and preprocessing the dataset, which proved to be challenging due to the varying sizes of the images.

After preprocessing the data, different architectures for the discriminator and generator were explored and tested for each of the mentioned networks to obtain better results. However, due to the limited size of the dataset, obtaining optimal results was challenging. Additionally, the effects of adding noise to input images were analyzed and their impact on the results was studied.

Overall, this project delved into the implementation and exploration of deep generative networks for image generation, showcasing the challenges and limitations that arise when working with limited data.

This project was completed as part of the "Neural Networks" (changed to "Neural Computing and Deep Learning") course at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT) in Tehran, Iran, taught by Professor Reza Safabakhsh(<safa@aut.ac.ir>). I took this course during my Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering at AUT in Spring 2022.
